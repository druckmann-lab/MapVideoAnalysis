'''
Short script that makes sure that the trial indices for the test and 
train folds are valid indices for the end-to-end training.

Since we have files that contain the trial indices from the end-to-end
trial filtering. I will just use those indices to match ours.

The difference is only very few (0-2) trials in each session, and the goal 
is to keep the test split size constant 64.
